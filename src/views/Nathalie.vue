          <p>Hi there! My name is Nathalie Lindqvist, a 26 year old woman who has a passion for that little extra. May it be a song performed by a favourite band such as Kent or Avenged Sevenfold, an exquisite scoop of chocolate ice cream or an extra hour spent on making a freshly coded web site look just right. Frontend development is songthing that will never be "just a job" for me. When there's so much to do and learn it's impossible to be bored!</p>
